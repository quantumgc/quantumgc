### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Cas](https://gchaudhuri.dev/) (they/them/theirs), though you may also know me as Gautam or Quantum.
I'm currently a PhD candidate in Differential Geometry/Mathematical Physics studying the dynamics of vortices in the Abelian Higgs model.
My work touches on many different aspects of geometry, but mainly focuses on Abelian gauge theories and vector bundles on Riemann surfaces.
I also perform numerical experiments to inform my work, repositories for this are kept here.

- ðŸ“« I keep an up to date [list](https://gchaudhuri.dev/#contact) of ways to contact me over on my personal webpage
